# My Blog

This is a simple, content-focused blog built with Jekyll, inspired by [Vitalik Buterin's blog](https://github.com/vbuterin/blog).

## Features

- Clean, minimal design focused on content
- Markdown support for easy writing
- Responsive layout for all devices
- Category organization
- Simple navigation
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- AI attestation system via [attest.ink](https://attest.ink) integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby (version 2.5.0 or higher)
- RubyGems
- GCC and Make

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blog.git
   cd blog
   ```

2. Install Jekyll and dependencies
   ```
   gem install jekyll bundler
   bundle install
   ```

3. Run the development server
   ```
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`

## Writing Posts

To create a new post, add a new file to the `_posts` directory with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. Include the following YAML front matter at the top:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS -0500
categories: [category1, category2]
attribution: human  # or 'ai claude opus 4' for AI-assisted content
---
```

Then write your post content using Markdown.

## AI Attestation System

This blog uses [attest.ink](https://attest.ink) to create cryptographic attestations for all content, declaring whether it was written by a human or with AI assistance.

**[ðŸ“– Read the full Attestation System Guide](docs/ATTESTATIONS.md)**

### Quick Start

Add attribution to your post's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
attribution: human              # Human-written
attribution: ai claude opus 4   # AI-assisted with Claude 4 Opus
attribution: ai gpt 4          # AI-assisted with GPT-4
---
```

Attestations are generated automatically during Jekyll build and displayed as subtle badges on each post.

## Working with Categories

This blog uses Jekyll collections to create category pages. When you add categories to your posts, you'll need to create corresponding category pages.

### Adding a New Category

1. Create a new file in the `_categories` directory with the format `category-name.md`
2. Add the following YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
layout: category
title: "Category: Your Category Name"
category: your_category_name
permalink: /categories/your_category_name/
---
```

Make sure the `category` value matches exactly what you use in your post's frontmatter (including case).

### Generating Categories Automatically

To help generate category files for all your existing categories:

1. Start your Jekyll server with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
2. Visit `http://localhost:4000/generate-categories.html`
3. This page will list all categories used in your posts and show the content needed for each category file
4. Copy the content for each category and create the corresponding files in the `_categories` directory

## Customizing the Theme

### Light/Dark Mode

The blog includes a light/dark mode toggle that respects user preferences. The theme automatically adapts based on:

1. User's explicit choice (via the toggle button)
2. User's system preference
3. Default to light mode if neither is available

Theme preferences are saved to localStorage for returning visitors.

## Deployment

This blog is designed to be easily deployed on GitHub Pages:

1. **Push to GitHub** - Just push your changes to the main branch
2. **Automatic Attestations** - GitHub Actions automatically generates attestations for new posts
3. **GitHub Pages** - Your site deploys automatically at `https://yourusername.github.io`

**No additional configuration needed!** The attestation system works out of the box.

For advanced deployment options, see the [Attestation System Guide](docs/ATTESTATIONS.md#github-deployment).
