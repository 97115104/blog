## about me

I'm an unoriginal techie located in San Francisco, currently in my early 30s. I accidentally started as a self-taught engineer after dropping out of a mostly failed attempt at preparation for law school. I started my work at Apple, then GitHub and a few other big names that would bore you. Because people generally tend to like me, I progressed through my career in vertical fashion, from engineering to recruiting because recruiters suck and I thought I'd be better, and I was before I moved on to program management then product management. I ended my career working for other people as an engineering leader but thanks to a confluence of events, a good idea, and too many STIs, I am now the founder of a Web3 startup called [status.health](https://status.health) focused on improving sexual wellness and reducing STI transmission rates.
