# About This Blog

This is a simple, content-focused blog inspired by [Vitalik Buterin's blog structure](https://github.com/vbuterin/blog).

### You'll find posts concerning my musings on the following topics:
 * Public health, especially sexual health
 * The startup founder journey
 * Technical things I learn along the way
 * Op-eds such as AI vs. human-generated work
 * Emerging technology such as ZKPs, AI, and quantum computing

## About Me

The name is Austin Harshberger. I'm a techie located in San Francisco (I know how unoriginal) and have worked in the tech world for more than a decade. I started as a self-taught engineer for companies such as Apple and IDEO, and progressed through my career from engineering to recruiting, to program management, product management, and engineering leadership. I am now the founder of a startup called [status.health](https://status.health).

I am an AI tools maxi and believe, strongly, that AI tools help more than they hurt but I also think AI tools are nowhere near as good as humans at any particular task--they are "generally" intelligent but not expert at anything regardless of how good you are at prompting them, i.e., "prompt engineering." With that said, this blog does not contain any AI-assisted content intentionally. My startup and other things I create do, however, and when they do, you'll know because I attest to which AI assisted me using badges which you can find available for free via another site I created: [attest.ink](https://attest.ink).

You can read more about me via this blog, my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aharshbe/) (I know how very un-degen of me), or via my bio on my startup's website: [https://status.health/team](https://status.health/team).
