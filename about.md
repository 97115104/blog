## About Me

The name is Austin Harshberger. I'm a techie located in San Francisco (I know how unoriginal) and have worked in the scene world for more than a decade. I started as a self-taught engineer for companies such as Apple and GitHub, and progressed through my career from engineering to recruiting, to program management, product management, and finally engineering leadership. I am now the founder of a Web3 startup called [status.health](https://status.health) focused on improving sexual wellness and reducing STI transmission rates.

I am an AI tools maxi and believe, strongly, that they help more than they hurt. I also think AI tools are nowhere near as good as humans at any particular task--they are "generally" intelligent but not expert at anything regardless of how good you are at prompting them. Blog posts on this site are not AI-assisted other than for grammar and spellinjg since I am terrible at both. All content is original, intentionally. This non-blog content on this site and the site itself, and many other things I create are AI assisted because humans are expensive to hire and I am poor. When I use AI, you'll know because I attest to which AI assisted me using badges somewhere within or near the content, such as in the footer of this blog. You can find these badges and how to implement them for free via a site Calude and I created: [attest.ink](https://attest.ink).

For the most part everything I create is free as a mostly open source developer, and you should feel free to use my words, my website content, etc, with no licnese required. I just ask for proper citation, e.g., `Harshberger, A, $DATE, $BLOG-POST-NAME` or `attest.ink, A. H. $DATE`. The exception to this rule is anything over at status.health or where I explicitly mark something under copyright with Â©. In those instances, just shoot me an email for permission or questions: founder@status.health.

If you'd like to grok futher, you can find more info about me on DuckDuckGo, my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aharshbe/), or the bio on my startup's website: [https://status.health/team](https://status.health/team).
