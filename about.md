# About This Blog

This is a simple, content-focused blog inspired by [Vitalik Buterin's blog structure](https://github.com/vbuterin/blog).

You'll find posts concerning my musings on the following topics:
* public health, especially sexual health
* the startup founder journey
* technical things I learn along the way
* Op-Ed such as AI vs. human-generated work
* Emerging technology such as ZKPs, AI, and quantum computing
